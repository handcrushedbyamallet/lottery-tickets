# Lottery Ticket Hypothesis Extended Experiments

This repository contains a replication of some of the results from the paper
"The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635. The writeup can be found here:

## Run the experiments
The experiments can be run by running
`lottery_ticket_hypothesis/run_experiment.py`. The parameters of the experiment
can be changed by modifying the parameters to the `ExperimentConfig`
instantiation in that file.

## Plots
The creation of the plots in the paper can be seen in the `notebooks` folder.
